            <summary>
              The ID of the parent task. Unreliable!
            </summary>
            <remarks>
              Required in order to find the parent element of a newly created task.
              Should really only be set when sending from the runner to the provider,
              not when creating tasks in <see cref="!:IUnitTestElement.GetTaskSequence"/>.
              The problem is that the tasks returned from <see cref="!:IUnitTestElement.GetTaskSequence"/>
              are collapsed based on equality, and each task would have a different
              parent task ID. Also, we'll end up with tasks in the runner that have
              a parent task ID that's doesn't match any of the tasks it knows about.
              <para>
                So, just like <see cref="P:JetBrains.ReSharper.TaskRunnerFramework.RemoteTask.Id"/>, this property should not be
                included in the equality comparers.
